# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** One sheriff in town — all state mutations flow through a single typed engine
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Remove Parsing from Hot Path

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 5 (Remove Parsing from Hot Path) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase (4-00, 4-01, 4-02 complete)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-23 — Plan 4-02 complete (Doctor surgery: checkEngineHealth + reconciliation removal)

Progress: [██████████████░] 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 1.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Engine Foundation | 5 | 23 min | 5 min |
| 2 - Sync + Prompt Migration | 2 | 5 min | 3 min |
| 3 - Event Reconciliation + Mandatory Tools | 5 | ~23 min | 5 min |
| 4 - Remove Parsing from Hot Path | 3 (so far) | 30 min | 10 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3-05 (3 min), 4-00 (5 min), 4-01 (15 min), 4-02 (10 min)
- Trend: Steady

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- ADR-004 approved: single-writer architecture with WorkflowEngine as sole mutation path
- SQLite backing store with JSONL event log — team infra built in Phase 1, not retrofitted
- Dual-write bridge in Phase 1 before making tools mandatory — telemetry validates LLM compliance first
- 1-01: Called migrateToV5() in both initSchema and migrateSchema for fresh/existing DB coverage
- 1-01: Used plain property instead of TS parameter property for Node strip-only mode compatibility
- 1-01: Phase detection minimal (pre-planning/planning/executing) — extends with commands in 1-02
- 1-03: Pure content renderers separated from disk writers for testability without DB
- 1-03: renderStateContent matches buildStateMarkdown format exactly for backward compat
- 1-03: All projection writes wrapped in try/catch per D-02 (non-fatal failure)
- 1-04: Dynamic import of workflow-engine.js in tool execute functions to avoid circular deps
- 1-04: Engine bridge in deriveState after cache check, before markdown parse
- 1-04: Telemetry uses module-level counters with copy-on-read for thread safety
- 1-05: Manifest includes all 5 entity types per D-06 — full DB dump, not curated
- 1-05: Event hash from cmd+params only (deterministic, ts/actor-independent)
- 1-05: afterCommand is non-fatal for projections, manifest, and events
- 2-01: Sync lock uses atomicWriteSync for crash-safe lock file creation
- 2-01: replay() suppresses afterCommand entirely per D-11 — projections still render but no event/manifest writes
- 2-01: acquireSyncLock accepts optional timeoutMs for testability (default 5000ms)
- 2-02: Capability check via state-manifest.json existence determines engine vs legacy sync path (D-03)
- 2-02: Read manifest + call restore() directly, not bootstrapFromManifest (pitfall #1: different source/target paths)
- 2-02: Runtime artifacts (units/) always file-copied even in engine path (D-02 hybrid)
- 2-03: Hard switch with no fallback — prompts do not offer checkbox-edit escape hatch per D-07
- 2-03: plan-slice migration is additive — file-write steps preserved, tool call added as new step 8
- 3-01: Static import of reconcileWorktreeLogs in auto-worktree.ts (mergeMilestoneToMain is sync, cannot await import)
- 3-01: reconcileWorktreeLogs takes base paths (not db file paths) matching event log location
- 3-02: realpathSync try/catch in isBlockedStateFile handles files that don't exist yet (pre-write path matching)
- 3-02: discuss.md/discuss-headless.md REQUIREMENTS.md writes left as-is — initial project setup, not status updates
- 3-02: complete-slice.md and reassess-roadmap.md residual REQUIREMENTS.md writes replaced with gsd_save_decision (found during audit)
- 3-03: tasks table has no created_at column — INSERT uses description/estimate/files/seq only (schema check required)
- 3-03: Empty IN() clause invalid in SQLite — guard added before transaction when migratedMilestoneIds is empty
- 3-03: needsAutoMigration() inside inner try/catch (not outer engine try) per Pitfall #4 — migration failure non-fatal
- 3-04: Compaction wired in WorkflowEngine.completeSlice (not workflow-commands.ts) — engine has basePath, commands layer does not
- 3-04: _milestoneProgress exported from workflow-commands.ts — returns { total, done, pct } for slice completion tracking
- 3-04: Static import of atomicWriteSync in workflow-events.ts — no circular dependency risk
- 3-05: CONFLICTS.md parsed with line-by-line regex — matches writeConflictsFile format exactly
- 3-05: resolveConflict re-writes CONFLICTS.md with empty worktreePath string on partial resolve (worktreePath is display-only)
- 3-05: Dynamic import of resolveConflict/listConflicts in ops.ts consistent with existing migrate handler pattern
- 4-00: TODO placeholders for checkEngineHealth tests (import would fail since function doesn't exist yet)
- 4-00: Multi-line import regex for state.ts boundary test to handle TypeScript multi-line import blocks
- 4-00: Removed-export tests use dynamic import + typeof check for runtime export presence validation
- 4-01: Exported cachedParse from files.ts so legacy/parsers.ts shares the same parse cache
- 4-01: Hot-path usage sites stubbed with safe defaults (false/null/empty) to keep TypeScript compiling
- 4-01: auto-prompts.ts and auto-dispatch.ts added as display callers (not in plan but required for compile)
- 4-02: Escalation logic kept as-is in doctor-proactive.ts: tracks generic errors, not bookkeeping-specific
- 4-02: RoadmapSliceEntry built from engine SliceRow with risk/demo defaults for isMilestoneComplete compat
- 4-02: STATE.md missing fix uses renderStateProjection() with deriveState() fallback
- 4-02: Blocker-without-replan detection uses engine task.blocker field instead of parseSummary

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Key risk: LLM compliance with tool calls must be validated via telemetry before tools become mandatory (gating Phase 3)
