# Project State

**Current Phase:** 01
**Current Plan:** 5 of 5
**Status:** Executing Phase 01
**Issue:** https://github.com/gsd-build/gsd-2/issues/2659
**ADR:** docs/ADR-004-capability-aware-model-routing.md
**Branch:** feat/capability-aware-model-routing

## Decisions

- getModelTier unknown default changed from "heavy" to "standard" (D-15: prevents silent bypass of user config)
- selectionMethod required on RoutingDecision to force all return sites to declare selection path
- scoreEligibleModels tie-break: score (>2pt gap) -> cost -> lexicographic model ID (deterministic)
- Double-extraction eliminated in classifyUnitComplexity (taskMeta extracted once, reused)
- Tests placed in model-router.test.ts and complexity-classifier.test.ts per plan, not capability-router.test.ts
- [Phase 01]: getEligibleModels replaces findModelForTier in downgrade path to enable multi-model eligible set for STEP 2 scoring
- [Phase 01]: buildFallbackChain helper extracted to deduplicate fallback assembly in scoring and tier-only paths
- [Phase 01 Plan 04]: emitBeforeModelSelect bound into ExtensionRuntime at ExtensionRunner construction (not bindCore) since it's a runner capability not a mode action
- [Phase 01 Plan 04]: First-override-wins semantics for before_model_select: first handler returning non-undefined wins, loop short-circuits
