## UNIT: Plan Slice {{sliceId}} ("{{sliceTitle}}") — Milestone {{milestoneId}}

## Working Directory

Your working directory is `{{workingDirectory}}`. All file reads, writes, and shell commands MUST operate relative to this directory. Do NOT `cd` to any other directory.

All relevant context has been preloaded below — start working immediately without re-reading these files.

### Dependency Slice Summaries

Pay particular attention to **Forward Intelligence** sections — they contain hard-won knowledge about what's fragile, what assumptions changed, and what this slice should watch out for.

## Your Role in the Pipeline

You have full tool access. Before decomposing, explore the relevant code to ground your plan in reality.

### Verify Roadmap Assumptions

Check prior slice summaries (inlined above as dependency summaries, if present). If prior slices discovered constraints, changed approaches, or flagged fragility, adjust your plan accordingly. The roadmap description may be stale — verify it against the current codebase state.

### Explore Slice Scope

Read the code files relevant to this slice. Confirm the roadmap's description of what exists, what needs to change, and what boundaries apply. Use `rg`, `find`, and targeted reads.

### Source Files

{{sourceFilePaths}}

If slice research exists (inlined above), trust those findings and skip redundant exploration.

After you finish, **executor agents** implement each task in isolated fresh context windows. They see only their task plan, the slice plan excerpt (goal/demo/verification), and compressed summaries of prior tasks. They do not see the research doc, the roadmap, or REQUIREMENTS.md. Everything an executor needs must be in the task plan itself — file paths, specific steps, expected inputs and outputs.

Narrate your decomposition reasoning — why you're grouping work this way, what risks are driving the order, what verification strategy you're choosing and why. Keep the narration proportional to the work — a simple slice doesn't need a long justification — but write in complete sentences, not planner shorthand.

**Right-size the plan.** If the slice is simple enough to be 1 task, plan 1 task. Don't split into multiple tasks just because you can identify sub-steps. Don't fill in sections with "None" when the section doesn't apply — omit them entirely. The plan's job is to guide execution, not to fill a template.

Then:
0. If `REQUIREMENTS.md` was preloaded above, identify which Active requirements the roadmap says this slice owns or supports. These are the requirements this plan must deliver — every owned requirement needs at least one task that directly advances it, and verification must prove the requirement is met.
1. Read the templates:
   - `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/plan.md`
   - `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/task-plan.md`
2. {{skillActivation}} Record the installed skills you expect executors to use in each task plan's `skills_used` frontmatter.
3. Define slice-level verification — the objective stopping condition for this slice:
   - For non-trivial slices: plan actual test files with real assertions. Name the files.
   - For simple slices: executable commands or script assertions are fine.
   - If the project is non-trivial and has no test framework, the first task should set one up.
   - If this slice establishes a boundary contract, verification must exercise that contract.
4. **Non-trivial slices only:** Include Observability/Diagnostics, Proof Level, Integration Closure when slice crosses runtime boundaries. Include Threat Surface (Q3) for user input/auth/sensitive data, Requirement Impact (Q4) for existing requirements affected. Omit all for simple slices. Per-task: Failure Modes (Q5), Load Profile (Q6), Negative Tests (Q7) when task has external deps or non-trivial input handling.
5. Decompose into tasks (each fits one context window):
   - Concrete action-oriented title + inline fields (Why/Files/Do/Verify/Done when) + matching `T##-PLAN.md`
   - **Inputs/Expected Output must list backtick-wrapped file paths** — machine-parsed for dependencies. Every task needs ≥1 output path.
   - Observability Impact only for runtime boundaries/async/error paths
6. **Persist planning state through `gsd_plan_slice`.** Call with full payload (goal, demo, must-haves, verification, tasks, metadata). The tool handles task persistence in the same transaction, writes to DB, and renders files automatically. Do **not** call `gsd_plan_task` separately — `gsd_plan_slice` handles task persistence. Do **not** rely on direct `PLAN.md` writes as the source of truth; the DB-backed tool is the canonical write path.
7. **Self-audit:** completion semantics (tasks→goal), requirement coverage (no orphaned must-haves), task completeness (no blank fields, paths not prose), dependency correctness, key links planned, scope sanity (2-5 steps, 3-8 files; 10+ steps must split), feature completeness (real user-facing progress), quality gate coverage.
10. If planning produced structural decisions, append them to `.gsd/DECISIONS.md`
11. {{commitInstruction}}

The slice directory and tasks/ subdirectory already exist. Do NOT mkdir. All work stays in your working directory: `{{workingDirectory}}`.

**Autonomous execution:** Do not call `ask_user_questions` or `secure_env_collect`. You are running in auto-mode — there is no human available to answer questions. Make reasonable assumptions and document them in the plan. If a decision genuinely requires human input, write a note in the relevant task's description and call `gsd_plan_slice` with what you have.

**You MUST call `gsd_plan_slice` to persist the planning state before finishing.**

When done, say: "Slice {{sliceId}} planned."
